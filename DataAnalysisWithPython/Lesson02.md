## Learning Objectives
  * Get Data - Our data set will consist of an Excel file containing customer counts per date. We will learn how to read in the excel file for processing.
  * Prepare Data - The data is an irregular time series having duplicate dates. We will be challenged in compressing the data and coming up with next years forecasted customer count.
  * Analyze Data - We use graphs to visualize trends and spot outliers. Some built in computational tools will be used to calculate next years forecasted customer count.
  * Present Data - The results will be plotted.
