# Lesson 0 - Setting up your environment 
## Things you will need to have on your machine
* Git
* Heroku CLI
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Intellij

## The Walkthrough 

1. Installing Git 
	* Open https://git-scm.com in your browser
  	* Download the installer for your machine 
  	* Run the installer application (accept the defaults for any questions)   

2. Installing the Heroku CLI 
	* Open https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli in your browser 
  	* Download the installer for your machine 
	* Run the installer application (accept the defaults for any questions)
  
3. Installing the JDK
  	* Open http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html in your browser
  	* Click on the JDK download button
  	* Download the JDK installer for your machine
  	* Run the installer application (accept the defaults for any questions)
  
4. Installing IDE
	* If you wish to use Intellij IDEA:
  		* Open https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ in your browser
  		* Download the installer for your machine
  		* If you are a student in a college or university, go to https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ and using your campus email, register to get a one year free license
		* Run the installer application (accept the defaults for any questions)
	* If you wish to use Eclipse:
		* Open http://www.eclipse.org/ in your browser
		* Click the Download button and run the installer on your machine
		* Select the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers
		* Once the software is installed, run Eclipse and install 
		* Click Help -> Eclipse Marketplace and install Spring Tools

5. Just to be on the safe side, reboot your machine

## What's Going On
The software you are downloading are the things you will need to write, compile and deploy java applications from your own machine.

### Writing your code
The software that is used to write Java programs and especially Spring Boot programs is an IDE or Integrated Development Environment. The leading IDE for Java is Eclipse (which is available at www.eclipse.org). But the best IDE for Java, in my opinion, is IntelliJ IDEA (which is available at www.jetbrains.com/idea). If you are a student, you can get IntelliJ IDEA for a year for free, but if not, you can work through the exercises in this book by using the 14-day demo version. 

### Compiling your code
In order to compile Java programs on your machine, you will need to download the JDK or Java Development Kit. This software is available on the Oracle website at www.oracle.com. You will need to install the proper JDK for your machine and reboot it before you will be able to get any of the lessons to work. 

## Deploying your code
To save your code and move completed programs to our hosting company, Heroku.com, you need to install the Heroku CLI and git. These will make it possible submit your code to source control and to transmit that code to Heroku.
