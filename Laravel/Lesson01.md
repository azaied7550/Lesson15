# Lesson
## Learning Objectives

## The Walkthrough
1. Create a new laravel application by typing "laravel new Lesson01" in the command prompt 

2. Create a Template 

Laravel already has pages set up, so you can modify these. Later on, you will also see how to create your own files and serve them. 

* Open welcome.blade.php. You will find it in the resources/views folder. 
Edt it to look like this: 

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
</body>
</html>
```

Run your application and open a browser, if you type in the URL http://localhost:8000 you should see this:
