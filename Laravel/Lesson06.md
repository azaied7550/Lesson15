# Lesson-06 Looping through items with Blade

## Learning Objectives
* How to loop through data in Blade

You are going to pull data from the database that you created in Lesson 4.
This means that the data already exists, and you do not have to re-create anything.

## The Walkthrough

1. Create a new Laravel project.

2. Create a course model.  You do not have to make any migrations, because you are not changing the database structure.

3. Create a route to get a list of courses and pass it to a view.

4. Create a view to display the list.
