# Lesson-17 Deploying to Heroku 

## Learning Objectives
- Create a new heroku application 
- Set up a default heroku database to be used post deployment
- Migrate tables to your heroku databse from the heroku console 

## The Walkthrough

1. Create a new repository (if you have not already initialized a git repository)

``` git
git init
```

2. Create a new heroku application. You can name it if you would like it to have a 'friendly' name.

``` shell 

heroku create myuniqueappname 

```

3. Create a database to be use to store this application's data on heroku: 
``` shell 


```

## What is Going On
- You can also seed test data to the databse to see it in a production environment
